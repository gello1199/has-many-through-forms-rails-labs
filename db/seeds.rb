# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Category.create(name: "Rock")
# Comment.create(content: "This is rock content")
# Post.create(title: "First Post", content: "This is the first post")
# User.create(username: "test", email: "test@test.com")
